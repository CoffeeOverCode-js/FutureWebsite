            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p id="biobox">
                My name is Ryan Fredericks, I live in CapeTown, South Africa. I am  17 year old male that has had a passion for tech ever since i was about 13 years old. I always knew that I would enjoy web development and software engineering due to the fact that it allow you to express yourself in a creative way through code without Limitations. I am aspiring to be a Full Stack Web Dev.
                 My first few months of learning Code i have managed to learn the basics of Javacript, html and css, which was used to create this site. I enjoy the concept of how a programmer never stops learning because tech is alway changing and that is what keep it exciting because there always something new to learn. The thing that motivates me to continue to learn to program is that I want to one day be able to share my knowledge to fellow programmers that may just be starting and to help them grow and love their work.
            </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p id="expbox">My first few months learing to code was very exciting for me. I have found that I pick up certain concepts rather wuickly and find my self tryign to learn more through youtube videos and blogs. My experience was not really what i thought of it as were people can just program non-stop for hours on end without breaks, but i find my self facing a problem every 30 - 40 min of code whether its a logical or syntax error i always try my hardest to solve the problem before asking for help just to increase my error handling skills which im sure will be needed when progresing higher in ym career. My hopes are that once i have enough knowledge that ill just be able to it down and think of a personal project to do on my own whether its a game,web application that shows the time of a given place, etc.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p id="edubox">My journey of learning the basics of Javascript, html and css was not easy by any means there was plenty of times where i stuglled for days on end getting one single button to do what its desinged to do but in the to just find out that adding <b>addEventListener("DomContentLoaded")</b> wrapped around it would solve the problem wa really funny to me because in the beggining it seems imposible but then when consulting someone with years of experince its a walk in the park for them because they were also once in my shoes. So far I have really enjoyd the projects that I have created through out my journey with every prpject i have done i learnt at least 2 new concepts such as the <b>addEventListener("DomContentLoaded")</b> and animation that loops through specific colors was really fun to exeriment with and to implement into my website.
            I am excited to move on to the next part of my course were we cover the basics/advanced Java with Object-Orientated-Programming</p>
